# College Housing Network Turtles

## Introduction
This java project was created by our group for our Software Engineering class. The project was used to apply concepts and best practices we learned in class. This included creating a proposal, requirements, creating use cases, identifying non-trivial steps, creating use case diagrams, creating sequence diagrams, creating a design class diagram, and applying GRASP patterns. The wiki page of our project contains pages for each iteration of our project. 

## Build

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/UTDClassroom/cse33540w2-s21-utdclassroom-groupproject-private-repo-cse33540w2-s21-group-2.svg?token=vPFB8GmDa4JQqZSViqag&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/UTDClassroom/cse33540w2-s21-utdclassroom-groupproject-private-repo-cse33540w2-s21-group-2)

Our project is integrated with Travis CI for continous integration. Whenever code is pushed to this repository, the code will be built and tested. Codecov is used for analyzing the code coverage based on the report generated by Travis CI. JUnit tests can be found under src/test/java/ in the repository.

## Run Program
To run our program you will want to run the ProjectUI.java class in your preferred IDE or command line. Our program is controlled via command line input. You will have the option to enter our program as Admin, Owner, or Student. Many operations require your userID which is given to you when register an account. Admins are allowed to manage listings, owners, and students. Owners can create listings for students to view. Students can view listings and edit their profiles.
